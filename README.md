![Screenshot displaying real and 8$ verification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avinashmg/fake-verification-remover/master/Screenshot.png)
1. Remove the verification marks added by users via subscribing to twitter blue and add a fraud icon instead of check mark.
2. Keep the Genuine verification done by twitter previously intact.
## How to use
Download the folder and allow developer options on extention settings and load extention from downloaded folder.
Currently not planning to publish on Chrome store. So this is the only way

**NOTE:** Twitter is currently making a lot of changes in their UI, so the some of the checkmarks might not be removed
